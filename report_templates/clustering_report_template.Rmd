To do this clustering analysis, we select those HPO pairs which have consistent or emergent pathways in KEGG, REACTOME or GO enrichment. Once we have done this selection, we performed a cluster analysis with these HPO pairs, thanks to the R package Linkcomm.

### KEGG: Number of clusters    
  
```{r  echo=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, message=FALSE }
	grid.arrange(
		produce_barplot("Average_Cluster_size_kegg_0.05", "", "Clst mean size", add=TRUE),
		produce_barplot("clusters_number_kegg_0.05", "", "Number of Clusters"),
		heights = c(1/5, 4/5)
	)
```		
  
**Figure X**: (**Top**) ***Clusters Size Average for KEGG analysis***. (**Bottom**) ***Number of Clusters for KEGG analysis***. The average size of clusters is very similar in all networks. However, the number of clusters varys. However, the number of clusters varies between real and random networks, being this greater in real networks. 


  
### KEGG: Number of Clusters which fits with an OMIM Disease  

```{r  echo=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, message=FALSE}

**Figure X**: (**Top-Left**) ***Number of different OMIM diseases that have a perfect match with clusters***. (**Top-Right**) ***Number of different OMIM diseases that match with clusters except from one phenotype***. (**Botton-Left**) ***Number of clusters that have a perfect match with OMIM diseases***.  (**Botton-Left**) ***Number of clusters that match with OMIM diseases except from one phenotype***.  High-confidence clusters have more clusters that match with OMIM diseases and those clusters coincide with more than one disease comparing with Low-confidece and with the it random models. The number of clusters and diseases increase when we allow a cluster match failure with respect to the disease.

**Figure X**: (**Top-Left**) ***Number of different OMIM diseases that have a perfect match with clusters***. (**Top-Right**) ***Number of different OMIM diseases that match with clusters except from one phenotype***. (**Botton-Left**) ***Number of clusters that have a perfect match with OMIM diseases***.  (**Botton-Left**) ***Number of clusters that match with OMIM diseases except from one phenotype***. High-confidence clusters have more clusters that match with OMIM diseases and those clusters coincide with more than one disease comparing with Low-confidece and with the it random models. The number of clusters and diseases increase when we allow a cluster match failure with respect to the disease.
